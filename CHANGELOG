# 0.1.1b

- Fixed auto copying URLs from the editor not working correctly
- Added an option to automatically mark newly uploaded files as private if the public profile is enabled
- Fixed rich embeds using the wrong file identifier
- Fixed invalid share URLs originating from public profiles (would result in a wrong file or a 404 error)
- Fixed the video player going off screen for mobile aspect ratio videos
- Added an option to recieve desktop notifications on important events like uploads failing or finishing: TODO FINISH
- Improved performance for all requests by loading database user info into the request context during auth
- Video card dropdown menus (the 3 dots one) can now be opened by right-clicking the card
- Videos will now be in a better quality by default if no compression settings are checked
- Added a new "Precise trimming" option which allows to trim with sub-ms precision at the cost of longer processing times. By default non-precise editing is enabled which may result in the first couple of frames appearing frozen.
- Fixed an error where refreshing the editor page would redirect back to the main page with a "You must be logged in" error
- Redesigned the stats block in the dashboard page to show more information
