    <h5>How to upload a video?</h5>
    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
        To uploads videos you can drag and drop them onto the dashboard page, upload via the editor using the "Save to cloud" button or click the "Upload" button either on your profile (on phones) or
        on the header (on PCs and tablets)
    </p>

    <h5>How to edit videos?</h5>
    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
        To edit videos click the "Editor" button on the header. From there you can upload videos from your device. To edit already uploaded videos, go to the dashboard, press the options button (3
        dots) and click "Edit"
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h5>My uploads seem to be stuck</h5>
    <p class="text-muted mb-3">If uploads seem to be stuck it could be an issue with your internet connection as videos first have to be uploaded to the server for editing.</p>
    <hr />

    <h5>Can I delete multiple videos at once?</h5>
    <p class="text-muted mb-3">
        Yes! To delete videos in bulk you have to change your view mode to "List" which will show selection boxes next to videos. After selecting a video a notification will appear that will allow you
        to delete multiple videos at once.
